# Movie_Recommendation
Movie recommendation is one of the most important features of machine learning. Amazon, Netflix, and many companies invest lot of time in these algorithms.

I am implementing movie recommendation using both user based collaborating filtering and item based collaborating filtering(on which amazon's recommendation works) in R. Also used clustering techniques to recommend movies to users.
